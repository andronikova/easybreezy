<h6>EasyBreezy is made to help you easily distribute your monthly income following 3 simple steps:</h6>
<br>
<div>
        <p>1. Fill in your income and if necessary update your monthly expenses and current values of your accounts.</p>
        <p>2. EasyBreezy distributes your money using its algorithm. </p>
        <p>3. (optional) You can correct payments by hand if needed and save all results to history, if you would like. </p>
</div>

<h6>Types of accounts</h6>
<p>There are three types of accounts in EasyBreezy: expenses, savings and goals.
    You can have unlimited number of accounts of each type.
    Table below shows main properties of account types.
<!--They differ from each other by a strategy to calculate monthly payments as well as by priority in which you distribute your money between them.-->
</p>
<table class="table">
    <thead>
        <tr >
            <td></td>
            <td style="font-size:20px; color:yellow;">expenses</td>
            <td style="font-size:20px; color:yellow;">savings</td>
            <td style="font-size:20px; color:yellow;">goals</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>user defined parameters</td>
            <td>value to pay monthly</td>
            <td>upper limit, <br> percentage of income</td>
            <td>upper limit,<br> date</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>monthly payment</td>
            <td>fixed,<br>set by user</td>
            <td>variable,<br>% of salary</td>
            <td>variable,<br>missing value divided <by></by> months to deadline</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>priority</td>
            <td>high</td>
            <td>medium</td>
            <td>low</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>
    <span style="color:yellow;">Expenses</span> are the payments with fixed monthly value.
This type of account is suitable for apartment rent, electricity bills, credit payments.
    It is also recommended to use this type of account for monthly allowance (your everyday expenses for food, hobbies, and other personal stuff)

</p>
<br>
<p>
    <span style="color:yellow;">Saving</span> accounts are for saving up some money.

    They correspond to regular payments which are defined as a fraction of your income.
    For example, you can save 10% of your income to gather nest-egg for retiremenet.
    You could use saving accounts to make some emergency savings for job loss or medical bills.
    <!--(in this case you may wish to put your upper limit as high as you can imagine). -->
    In this case you can put upper limit for your savings, so monthly payments stop as soon as you reach this value.

</p>
<p>
    We ask you to choose one <span style="color:yellow;">reserve</span> account among your savings.
This account is used in case your income doesn't cover your expenses.
See section "account priority" to read about this situation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <span style="color:yellow;">Goal</span> accounts can be used for saving up for special goals.
You should provide the date and the amount of money you would like to have by the date.
Monthly payment is calculated by taking into account missing amount (equal to goal value minus already saved value) and the deadline.
For example, you can use goal account to save up for summer vacation, planned reconstruction works or for some expensive purchase (e.g. car, iphone).
</p>
<br>


<h6>Account priority</h6>
<p>Account priority is important if your income is not enough to cover all your payments.
In this case you should choose  which accounts to replenish first.
</p>

<p>
    EasyBreezy considers expenses accounts to have the highest priority since you always must pay the bills.
    Savings have intermediate priority. Goals have the lowest priority since they are less important for your survival.
</p>
<p>
    If your income doesn't cover all your expenses, money from the reserve account are used (Fig. 1).
    In this situation there are no replenishes for saving and goal accounts.
</p>
<p>If your income does cover all your expenses, the saving accounts are replenished (Fig. 2).
If residue is less than total sum of savings payments, it is distributed between all savings in proportion.
</p>
<p>Goals are replenished if your income covers all your expenses and all savings.
    If residue is not enough to cover all goals, it is distributed between all goals in proportion (Fig. 3).
</p>

<p>It may happen that after all you still have non-zero residue (Fig. 4).
    In this case you may add it to any account you wish.
