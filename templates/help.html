<h6>EasyBreezy is made to help you easily distribute your monthly income following 3 simple steps:</h6>
<br>
<div>
        <p>1. Fill in your income and, if necessary, update monthly expenses and current value of your accounts.</p>
        <p>2. EasyBreezy distributes your money using its algorithm. </p>
        <p>3. (optional) You can correct payments by hand, if needed, and save all results to history, if you want. </p>
</div>

<h6>Types of accounts</h6>
<p>There are three types of accounts in EasyBreezy: expenses, savings and goals. Table below shows main properties of accounts.
<!--They differ from each other by a strategy to calculate monthly payments as well as by priority in which you distribute your money between them.-->
</p>
<table class="table">
    <thead>
        <tr >
            <td></td>
            <td style="font-size:20px; color:yellow;">expenses</td>
            <td style="font-size:20px; color:yellow;">savings</td>
            <td style="font-size:20px; color:yellow;">goals</td>
        </tr>

            <td>upper limit,<br> date</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>high</td>

<br>
<p>
    <span style="color:yellow;">Expenses</span> are the payments with fixed monthly value.
This type of account is suitable for apartment rent, electricity bills, credit payments.
    It is also recommended to use this type of account for monthly allowance (your everyday expenses for food, hobbies, and other personal stuff)

</p>
<br>
<p>
    <span style="color:yellow;">Saving</span> accounts are for saving up some money.
It is payments you would like to make regularly. The value of monthly payment is some fraction of you income.
You also can put upper limit for your savings. Monthly payments  will stop as soon as you accumulate this sum.
You could use saving accounts to make some emergency savings (for job loss) or nest-egg for retiremenet.
</p>
<p>
    We will ask you to choose one <span style="color:yellow;">reserve</span> account among your savings.
This account will be used in case your income can't cover your expenses (see Fig.1).
See section "account priority" to read about this situation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <span style="color:yellow;">Goal</span> accounts are for saving up for special goal.
You should know the date and the amount of money you would like to have by the date.
Monthly payment will be calculated by taking into account missed sum and deadline.
For example, you can to use goal account to save up for summer vacation or for some expensive purchase (e.g. car).
</p>
<br>


<h6>Account priority</h6>
<p>Account priority is important when your income is not enough to cover all your payments.
In this situation you should choose - which accounts you want to replenish first.
</p>

<p>
    In EasyBreezy expenses accounts have the highest priority. It means, that at first income goes to expenses.
    Savings have middle priority. Goals have low priority.
</p>
<p>

    If income is not enough to cover all your expenses, money from reserve account would be used (Fig. 1).
    In this situation there would be no replenishes for saving and goal accounts.
</p>
<p>If after repayment of expenses there are non-zero remains in income, the saving accounts are replenished (Fig. 2).
If remains are less than total sum of savings payments, remains are distributed between all savings in proportion.
</p>
<p>Goals are replenished in the end.
    If remains are not enough to cover all goals, they are distributed between all goals in proportion (Fig. 3).
</p>

<p>It could happen that after all you still have non-zero remains (Fig. 4).
    In this case you may add it to any account you wish.
